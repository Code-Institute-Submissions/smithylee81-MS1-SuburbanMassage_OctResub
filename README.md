## User Experience (UX)
---

- ### User Stories

    - #### First Time Visitor Goals
        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the purpose of the site, what treatments are available and learn more about the massage therapist.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to see positive feedback from previous clients and access social media information to build my confidence in the therapist to help make a decision on whether I choose this particular service or not.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to clearly see what the costs of treatments are, which is also a determining factor in choosing any service.
        4. As a First Time Visitor, I also want to to be able to make effortless contact with the therapist should I choose to proceed, whether this is submitting an online enquiry or contacting via Facebook, Instagram or Twitter.

    - #### Returning Visitor Goals
        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to see if any new treatments are available and any special offers.  
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to book a treatment again with ease and have consistency in the navigation of the site. 

    - #### Frequent User Goals

        2. As a Frequent User, I want to navigate again with ease and consistency to book my next treatment hassle free.


- ### Design

  - #### Colour Scheme
    - ##### A blend of natural earthy 'nurturing' colouring in conjunction with other nature orientated colours of purple/lilac blends to set a peaceful and tranquil scene for the user. 

  - #### Typography
    - ##### A bold but soft 'comforting feel' font was used to provide the user with a gentle experience in line with the overall purpose of the site in providing a relaxing and calming service. 

  - #### Imagery
    - ##### To coincide with the colour scheme and overall 'feel' of the site a relaxing image of someone having a massage is used for the main picture on the site with purple/lilac tones for that grounding and relaxation feel.

- ### UX Design Planes
    - #### Strategy
        - ##### My aim of the design is to make this a simple, stress free, ease of use website for individuals wishing to book for a massage treatment.

    - #### Scope
        - ##### For potential clients I want to provide them with a brief synopsis of my who I am, my background, qualifications, and experience. Providing an option for contact also should they wish to ask more about the treatments on offer.

    - #### Structure 
        - ##### I want the site to be intuitive, consistent, and easy to navigate. I aim to use separate 'cards' to highlight the benefits of massage, the treatments on offer and details about me all in any easy to see layout. I aim to keep it minimalistic so that it's easy on the eye and not weighed down with too much detail and loose a potential clientâ€™s interest.

    - #### Skeleton 
        - ##### Wireframes - [View](https://github.com/smithylee81/MS1-SuburbanMassage/commit/c81d4eb5b4067c19c9ff527003819b947fb2f464) Note basic drawings have been produced rather than on the Balsamiq website due to time constraints, this will be added should time allow. 

    - #### Surface
        - ##### The colour scheme together with the imagery described was used to create an overall pleasant, relaxing, easy on the eye experience.

        2. The user has two options, hover over and click the page links to each section or scroll down, both of which will lead them to the same areas. The hover effect works well assisting the user in seeing which section they are selecting.
        3. As a first time visitor, the user can select the Testimonials option and read feedback from customers/clients. 
        4. On the Contact Us page the user can complete the enquiry form and subit this using the clearly identifed 'Send my Enquiry' button, the user receives a confirmation via a new page stating 'Thanks!' with a link to return to the original site.

## Further Testing 

- ### Manual Testing of each section
    - #### Home Page/Navigation Bar: All page links were tested to ensure they take the user to the desired area on the page, the dropdown menu was also tested on smaller devices to ensure the user still had these options on their mobile/smaller device. 

        1. Testing the navigation bar to ensure this takes the user to the different areas on the page:
    
    - #### Home Page, it was noted that this took the user to the 'Suburban Massage' title however the 'about us' and other info in this section was not visible requiring the user to scroll down slightly to find the info (see Known/Solved Bugs for further info on this):

### Testing Site Responsiveness
- ####

### Known/Solved Bugs
- #### Upon selecting the home page link this takes the user to the 'Suburban Massage' heading below the main page picture (as demonstrated above in the further testing section)however the user has to scroll down a little to see the 'About Us' detail, the initial HTML showed that the 'id' tag "home" was attached to the opening page. To correct this an 'id' was added to the H3 heading 'Suburban Massage' as id="AboutUs" and the 'a class="nav-link" href changed to href"#AboutUs".
- #### Initial HTML   
![Initial Home Page HTML](assets/images/HomePageNavLinkIssue.png "Initial HTML")

- #### Updated HTML
![Updated Home Page HTML](assets/images/UpdatedHomePageHTML.png "Updated HTML")

- #### User view following HTML changes
![Corrected Home Page View](assets/images/CorrectedHomePageView.png "Corrected Home Page Test View")

- #### After completing the fields in the 'Contact Us' section and clicking the 'Send My Enquiry' button the page changes to a different page with an error message stating 'Error response'. To correct this, following review of YouTube Video referenced below in 'Acknowledgements', a Form Action was added with the relevant email address and this was tested to activate this and provide a confirmation to the user that their form had been sent.

## Project Barriers & Solutions

- ### Difficulty with incorporating a massage mp4 video into the project, eventually used an image as was unable to solve. 
- ### Diffciulty with contact form as wanted to incorporate radio buttons to allow the user to select the type of massage they were interested in; eventually due to diffciulty with placement of this I opted for a standard text area on the form.
